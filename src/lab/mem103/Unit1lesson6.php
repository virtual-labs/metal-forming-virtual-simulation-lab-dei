Aluminum is derived from bauxite, a mineral mined from the earth. Two to three tonnes of bauxite are required to produce one tonne of alumina and two tonnes of alumina are required to produce one tonne of aluminium metal. The aluminium industry relies on the Bayer's process to produce alumina from bauxite.<br /><br />

3. <b>Capability</b>: It has a capability of being cast, forged, machined, formed, and welded. Aluminum sections can be joined by the use of adhesives, clips, bolts, rivets.<br />
4. <b>Lightweight</b>: Aluminum weighs less by volume than most other metals. It is about one-third the weight of iron, steel, copper, or brass.<br />
5. <b>Excellent Thermal Conductor</b>: It conducts heat better than other common metals.<br />

<dt><b><a name="effect">6.20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effect of various non-ferrous metals on alloying with ferrous metals</a></b></dt>
<dd><p>
<b>Chromium</b> is used as an alloying element in carbon steels to increase hardenability, corrosion resistance, and shock resistance. It imparts high strength with little loss in ductility.<br /><br />
<b>Nickel</b> increases the toughness, strength, and ductility of steels, and lowers the hardening temperatures.<br /><br />
<b>Manganese</b> is used in steel to produce greater toughness, wear resistance, easier hot rolling, and forging. An increase in manganese content decreases the weldability of steel.<br /><br />
<b>Molybdenum</b> increases hardenability. The impact fatigue property of the steel is improved with up to 0.60 percent molybdenum.<br /><br />
<b>Titanium</b> used as additional alloying agents in low-carbon content, corrosion resistant steels. Supports resistance to intergranular corrosion after the metal is subjected to high temperatures for a prolonged time period.<br /><br />
<b>Tungsten</b>, as an alloying element in tool steel that retains its hardness at high temperatures.<br /><br />
<b>Vanadium</b> is used to help control grain size. It is also added to steel during manufacture to remove oxygen.<br /><br />
<b>Silicon</b> is added to steel to obtain greater hardenability and corrosion resistance, and is often used with manganese to obtain strong and tough steel.<br /><br />
<b>How titanium can be distinguished from steel</b>?<br />
Titanium can be distinguished from steel by a copper sulfate solution. The solution will not react with titanium, but will leave a coating of copper on steel.<br /><br />
<b>What is the Design weaknesses of aluminium</b>?<br />
Design weaknesses of aluminium is difficult to arc weld.<br /><br />
<b>What is the effect on the properties of nickel when it is mixed with: 1. Chromium, 2. Manganese, 3. Cobalt.</b><br />
When nickel is used with chromium, it is resistant to high temperature oxidation and corrosion.<br />
When combined with manganese it is resistant to oxidation and reduction at elevated temperatures.<br />
Nickel with cobalt provides high heat resistance which makes it useful in chemical industry.<br /><br />
<b>How cobalt achieves high strength</b>?<br />
Cobalt achieves its strength through solid solution strengthening and precipitation hardening. Cobalt based materials have low machinability because of rapid work hardening that takes place at elevated temperatures.<br /><br />
<b>How following metals are distinguished from each other through chemical test</b>?<br />
Monel metal from Inconel<br />
Magnesium from aluminum<br />
Monel can be distinguished form Inconel by one drop of nitric acid applied to the surface. It will turn blue-green on Monel, but will show no reaction on Inconel.<br />
Magnesium can be distinguished from aluminum using silver nitrate, which will leave a black deposit on magnesium, but not on aluminum.
